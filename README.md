# CS8803-DRL-DDPG

Code implementation for DDPG with explanation of algorithm which can be imported and used for any continuous action space environment. Heavily adapted from the TD3 paper implementation https://github.com/sfujim/TD3/tree/master as well as from the DDPG paper itself https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971. Some plotting code was also taken from the class's hw1_advanced.ipynb notebook.

Simply run the """DDPG Implementation.ipynb""" notebook and change hyperparameters and environment as needed. Code from notebook can also be exported to python scripts and adapted for custom use cases. The actor and critic policy networks are limited to MLPs but custom architectures can be created and used with this DDPG implementation.
